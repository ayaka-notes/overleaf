# S3

{% hint style="info" %}
This document covers the setup of S3 in Server CE and Overleaf Pro. A [separate guide](../../maintenance/s3-migration.md) can be found on migrating existing data to S3 compatible storage.
{% endhint %}

## When to consider using S3 for data storage

For instances with fewer than 1000 seats we recommend using local disk storage with regular [consistent backups](https://docs.overleaf.com/on-premises/maintenance/data-and-backups#performing-a-consistent-backup).

For larger instances with more than 1000 seats that reach limits of their local storage (size or throughput), we recommend using a S3 compatible object storage back end over other network based storage solutions like NFS.

## S3 compatible object storage options

Here are the most popular options for S3 compatible object storage:

* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), managed, we suggest picking AWS S3 when running Overleaf CE/Server Pro on AWS
* [MINIO](https://min.io/), self-hosted
* [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en/), self-hosted
* Other hosting providers also have some kind of managed S3 compatible object storage, you may want to use these instead of running your own when already running Overleaf CE/Server Pro at such a provider.

## Latency considerations when picking a S3 compatible object storage

The latency between the Server CE/Server Pro instance and your S3 compatible object storage is a big contributor to the time it takes to complete the migration. The latency also impacts the file-upload performance in Server CE/Server Pro and slow file-downloads can have a big impact on PDF compile times as well. We suggest minimizing the geo-graphical distance between your Server CE/Server Pro instance and the S3 compatible object storage. In a managed environment, this would mean provisioning a bucket in the same region, and for an on-premise solution, running the two on the same campus.

## S3 setup

We need four "buckets" and two restricted user accounts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Buckets should **not** be publicly accessible
{% endhint %}

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="279"></th><th width="152"></th><th width="97"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bucket</td><td>Usage</td><td>Service</td><td>Previously in <code>/var/lib/overleaf/data</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>overleaf-user-files</code></td><td>project user files</td><td>filestore</td><td><code>user_files</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>overleaf-template-files</code></td><td>template files</td><td>filestore</td><td><code>template_files</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>overleaf-project-blobs</code></td><td>project history blobs</td><td>history and read-only filestore</td><td><code>history/overleaf-project-blobs</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>overleaf-chunks</code></td><td>history chunks</td><td>history</td><td><code>history/overleaf-chunks</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

You may want/need to pick a different name, be sure to use the custom buckets in all the commands.

The following will use placeholders for actual credentials:

<table><thead><tr><th width="431">Environment variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>OVERLEAF_FILESTORE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code></td><td>The access key/username of the restricted user of the filestore service.</td></tr><tr><td><code>OVERLEAF_FILESTORE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code></td><td>The secret key/password of the restricted user of the filestore service.</td></tr><tr><td><code>OVERLEAF_HISTORY_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code></td><td>The access key/username of the restricted user of the history service.</td></tr><tr><td><code>OVERLEAF_HISTORY_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code></td><td>The secret key/password of the restricted user of the history service.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Server CE and Server Pro only needs a small set of permissions on each bucket:

* create object
* get object
* delete object
* list bucket

### Access Policies

Here is how a policy for the filestore user could look like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-user-files"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-user-files/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-project-blobs/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-template-files"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-template-files/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is how a policy for the history user could look like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-project-blobs"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-project-blobs/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-chunks"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::overleaf-chunks/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
