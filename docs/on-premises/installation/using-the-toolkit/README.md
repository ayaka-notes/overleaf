# Using the Toolkit

The Toolkit is the recommended way to deploy and manage Overleaf Server CE and Overleaf Pro, also server Pro instances.

In this section we will guide you through downloading the Toolkit from GitHub, familiarizing yourself with some of the Toolkit's commands, and configuring some basic settings. By the end of this page you should have a running on-premises instance of Overleaf.

For more details, see the [Toolkit repository](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) on GitHub.
