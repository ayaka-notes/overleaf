# 4. Get Overleaf Pro Images

Overleaf Pro is distributed as a Docker image on the [GHCR](https://github.com/ayaka-notes/overleaf-pro/pkgs/container/overleaf-pro/) registry, with <mark style="color:green;">**open access**</mark> to anyone.

#### Ayaka-notes Toolkit Users

If you are using [ayaka-notes/overleaf-toolkit](https://github.com/ayaka-notes/overleaf-toolkit), Overleaf Pro can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Community Edition, so you can use your existing settings and customizations. Enable Pro in the Toolkit by editing `config/overleaf.rc` and setting the `SERVER_PRO` environment variable:

{% code title="config/overleaf.rc" %}
```
SERVER_PRO=true
```
{% endcode %}

The next time you run `bin/up`, the Toolkit will automatically download and use the Server Pro image.

#### Official Toolkit Users

To get a Pro image, run the following command to pull:

{% code title="Pull Docker Images" %}
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ayaka-notes/overleaf-pro:latest
```
{% endcode %}

Then, add a file named `docker-compose.override.yml` with the following or similar content into the `overleaf-toolkit/config` directory:

{% code title="docker-compose.override.yml" %}
```yml
