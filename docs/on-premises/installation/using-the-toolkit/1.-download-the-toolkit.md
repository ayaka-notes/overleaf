### Clone the Overleaf Toolkit repository

To install the Toolkit you'll need to navigate to the intended installation path and then clone the Overleaf Toolkit GitHub repository using this command:

{% code title="Clone repository" %}
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayaka-notes/toolkit.git ./overleaf-toolkit
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To prevent any potential permissions issues we recommend installing the Toolkit in your user's `$HOME` directory.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Change into the toolkit directory

Wait for the cloning process to complete then let's switch into the newly created `overleaf-toolkit` directory:

{% code title="Change directory" %}
```bash
cd ./overleaf-toolkit
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
