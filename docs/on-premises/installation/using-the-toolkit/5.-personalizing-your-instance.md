# 5. Personalizing your instance

### Personalizing your instance <a href="#personalizing-your-instance" id="personalizing-your-instance"></a>

Before you start your Overleaf instance for the first time, update the `config/variables.env` configuration file with your custom information.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Edit the variables file

Open `config/variables.env` in your favorite text editor and update the environment variables below with the required values.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Required environment variables

Update the following variables in `config/variables.env`:

| Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Example                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `OVERLEAF_SITE_URL`           | Where your instance of Overleaf is publicly available. This is used in public links, and when connecting over websockets, so **must be configured correctly**! | `https://overleaf.lilliput.com` |
| `OVERLEAF_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | This email address will be used as the `from` address for all outgoing emails.                                                                                 | `no-reply@lilliput.com`         |
| `OVERLEAF_ADMIN_EMAIL`        | The email address where users can reach the person who runs the site.                                                                                          | `it-services@lilliput.com`      |

Once you have updated these environment variables, save and quit.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Start your instance

To start your instance run:

{% code title="Start the instance" %}
```
bin/up
```
{% endcode %}

This command will download the required images, create the containers (using your customizations), and start the instance. You should see log output from the various Docker containers.

To start them up again later (without attaching to the log output) run:

{% code title="Start without attaching to logs" %}
```
bin/start
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Toolkit uses `docker compose` to manage the Overleaf Docker containers. The Toolkit provides a set of scripts which wrap `docker compose` and take care of most details for you.
{% endhint %}

If all goes well, you should be able view the log in page for your new Overleaf instance by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) or [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) in your browser.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on your network configuration and where your Overleaf instance is hosted, you may need to make additional configuration changes. See the Toolkit settings for more details:
