# 4. Get Overleaf CEP Images

#### Obtaining CEP Image <a href="#obtaining-server-pro-image" id="obtaining-server-pro-image"></a>

Overleaf CEP@yu-i-i is distributed as a Docker image on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/overleafcep/sharelatex) registry, while Overleaf@Ayaka-notes is distributed on [ghcr register](https://github.com/ayaka-notes/overleaf/pkgs/container/overleaf).

### Pull CEP image

To get a CEP image, run the following command to pull:

{% code title="Pull Docker Images" %}
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ayaka-notes/overleaf:latest
```
{% endcode %}

Then, add a file named `docker-compose.override.yml` with the following or similar content into the `overleaf-toolkit/config` directory:

{% code title="docker-compose.override.yml" %}
```yml

services:
    sharelatex:
        image: ghcr.io/ayaka-notes/overleaf:latest
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Switching to CEP

CEP can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Community Edition, so you can use your existing settings and customizations. Enable CEP in the Toolkit by editing `config/overleaf.rc` and setting the `SERVER_PRO` environment variable:

{% code title="config/overleaf.rc" %}
```
SERVER_PRO=true
```
{% endcode %}

The next time you run `bin/up`, the Toolkit will automatically download and use the Server Pro image.
