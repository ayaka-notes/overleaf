# Introduction

Whether you're a researcher interested in running the Community Editition in your trusted workgroup or an enterprise organisation wanting to integrate CEP into your existing infrastructure, to get started, we always highly recommend setting up your new instance using our [Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) with the default Community Edition image as doing so is a great way to familiarize yourselves with the platform's requirements and helps ensure a smooth experience when deciding to upgrade to CEP .

Like the Community Edition, CEP comes as a Docker container and is a direct drop in replacement and additionally includes features such as SSO provided via LDAP and SAML2, improved security, tracked changes, comments, our optimized version of TeX Live, templates and administration panel.

Once you've depolyed the Community Edition using the Toolkit and familiarized yourself with the application, you can easily switch to CEP by following the instructions [here](https://docs.overleaf.com/on-premises/installation/using-the-toolkit/4.-choose-community-edition-or-server-pro#switching-to-server-pro).
