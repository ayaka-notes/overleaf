# Introduction

Whether you're a researcher interested in running the Community Edition in your trusted workgroup or an enterprise organisation wanting to integrate Server Pro into your existing infrastructure, to get started, we always highly recommend setting up your new instance using our [Toolkitarrow-up-right](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) with the default Community Edition image as doing so is a great way to familiarize yourselves with the platform's requirements and helps ensure a smooth experience when deciding to upgrade to Server Pro.

Like the Community Edition, Server Pro comes as a Docker container and is a direct drop-in replacement and additionally includes features such as SSO provided via LDAP and SAML2, improved security, tracked changes, comments, our optimized version of TeX Live, templates and an administration panel.

Once you've deployed the Community Edition using the Toolkit and familiarized yourself with the application, you can easily switch to Server Pro by following the instructions [here](installation/using-the-toolkit/4.-get-overleaf-cep-images.md#switching-to-server-pro).

{% hint style="info" %}
A Server Pro license allows you to run the application in a production environment as well as one in a non-production/sandbox environment; it is highly recommended that you provision a non-production environment for testing.
