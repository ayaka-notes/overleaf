† There's no enforced limit on total project size. However, you may find some technical limitations when working with very large projects. We recommend a maximum project size of 500 MB, or less than 100 MB if using our [Git integrationarrow-up-right](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_integration). Projects above these sizes may work, but staying within these limits will give you the best experience.
