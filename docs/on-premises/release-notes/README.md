# Release notes

{% hint style="success" %}
Our Overleaf Pro license allows you to run the application in **any environment** without limit; it is highly recommended that you provision a non-production environment for testing.

### Understanding Overleaf Version Numbers

Overleaf uses semantic-style version numbers in the form **6.X.y**.

* **6.X** represents the major release series. When a new **6.X.0** version is released, it becomes the baseline for that generation.
* **y** represents patch updates within the same major series. Subsequent releases (for example **6.X.1**, **6.X.2**, …) are typically maintenance updates built on top of **6.X.0**, containing bug fixes, security fixes, and small improvements rather than large feature changes.

### Overleaf Pro Version

Our Overleaf Pro version numbers are fully aligned with the official Overleaf releases. Unless otherwise specified, all published releases are full-feature Server Pro edition images.
