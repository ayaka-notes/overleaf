We recommend that the on-site administrator of your Overleaf instance has:

* [x] General IT administration skills
* [x] Familiarity with Linux command line tools
* [x] General networking knowledge and troubleshooting skills
* [x] Experience backing up and restoring production systems
* [x] Experience running applications using Docker is a bonus
* [x] Experience with coordinating maintenance windows for upgrades of live production systems

We find that on-site administrators with these skills will be able to provide the best experience for users of Overleaf at your organization.
